# CODESTYLE

## General Rules

-   Keep code simple and readable.
-   Use small, focused functions and components.
-   Avoid unnecessary abstractions.

## Backend (.NET)

-   Use ASP.NET Core Web API controllers.
-   Organize code into:
    -   Controllers
    -   Services
    -   Repositories
    -   Models
    -   DTOs
-   Use constructor injection for dependencies.
-   Async method naming: suffix with "Async".
-   Use guard clauses to keep methods flat.

## Frontend (React)

-   Use functional components only.
-   Use React hooks for state and effects.
-   Organize code into:
    -   `src/pages/`
    -   `src/components/`
    -   `src/api/`
-   Use React Router for routing.
-   Keep components small and single-purpose.

## Git

-   Commit in small, focused increments.
-   Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
